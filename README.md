Collection of Post
=================

Experimenting with collections of posts as pblication and building cards using CSS Grid
------------


Please note that no markup is official. The use of a collection post in experimental.

Also I am learning CSS Grid as I go so I define more explicit girds as I see easier in boxes and do not know the short code.

The media queries also have to be written. I tried to use the fraction element to reduce the amount of queries.

Currently the grid collapses fine until screens smaller than 650px.
