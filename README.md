Collection of Post
=================

Experimenting with collections of posts for publication and building cards using CSS Grid
------------


Please note that no markup is official. The use of a collection post is experimental.

Also I am learning CSS Grid as I go so I define more explicit grids as I can more easily visualize boxes and do not know the short codes.

The media queries also have to be written. I tried to use the fraction element to reduce the number of queries.

Currently the grid collapses fine until screens smaller than 650px.
